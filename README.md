# berta_telegram_bot

# PROBLEM:

Berta does not really address any problem. She just assists in the user ordering coffee.

# BOT WORKS:

If Berta (at the end of the conversation) replies with a statement that includes her saying that the user must enter \start to make another order or start again, then Berta is functioning 100%. Berta is designed to always end a conversation, be it after ordering coffee, handling a complaint, or handling a suggestion, by letting the user know that they must enter '\start' to begin again.

# BOT LIMITATIONS:

Berta will always have a response stating that the request or phrase entered by the user is not understood, and that the user must rephrase it.

# TIPS for usage:

Follow the prompts made by Berta (the bot).
